# Bank_Account_Infrustructure

This project is a part of the learning process with M.r Fred Baptiste "https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbaptiste/"
in this Project I will be using python in both functional and object oriented programming styles.

python built in `datetime` module is utilized; however, external libraries such as `pytz` might become handy.
install pytz using `pip install pytz`
